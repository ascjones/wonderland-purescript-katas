# wonderland-fsharp-katas

Work in progress: one day, this will be an PureScript port of

## How to Do the Katas

First, clone or fork this repo. Each of the katas are in their own directory and
are self contained PureScript projects.  You `cd` into the project and run
`bower install` to download the dependencies followed by `pulp test` to show the
failing tests, then complete the code to make the  tests pass. Each project has
the instructions in its own _README.md_ file.

If you don't have [PureScript](A build tool for PureScript projects) and  [Pulp
(A build tool for PureScript
projects)](https://github.com/bodil/pulp#installation),  follow the links for
installation steps.
